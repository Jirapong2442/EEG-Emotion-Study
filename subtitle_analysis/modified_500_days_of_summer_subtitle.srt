
9
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,160
This is a story of boy meets girl.

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,600
The boy, Tom Hansen
of Margate, New Jersey...

13
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:15,440
grew up believing
that he'd never truly be happy...

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
until the day he met "the one."

17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,680
This belief stemmed from early exposure
to sad British pop music...

20
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,080
and a total misreading
of the movie The Graduate.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,400
Elaine! Elaine!

24
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:30,360
The girl, Summer finn
of Shinnecock, Michigan...

25
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,600
did not share this belief.

28
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,080
Since the disintegration
of her parents' marriage...

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,320
she'd only loved two things.

32
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:41,400
The first was her long, dark hair.

33
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,440
The second was how easily
she could cut it off...

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,400
and feel nothing.

37
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,560
Tom meets Summer on January eighth.

40
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,760
He knows almost immediately
she's who he's been searching for.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,080
This is a story of boy meets girl.

44
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,120
But you should know up front...

45
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,120
this is not a love story.

48
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,840
#They made a statue of us #

49
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,080
#And put it on a mountaintop #

52
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,480
# Now tourists come and stare at us #

53
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:27,160
# Blow bubbles with their gum #

56
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,400
#Take photographs of fun #

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,360
# Have fun #

60
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,880
# They'll name a city after us #

61
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,360
# And later say it's all our fault #

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,560
#Then they'll give us a talking to #

65
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,120
#Then they'll give us a talking to #

68
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,080
# 'Cause they've got years of experience #

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
# Living in a den of thieves #

74
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,160
# Rummaging for answers in the pages #

77
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:13,000
# Living in a den of thieves #

80
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,440
# And it's contagious #

81
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,640
# And it's contagious #

84
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,160
# And it's contagious #

85
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,920
# And it's contagious #_

91
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,600
We didn't know who else to call.

94
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,720
it's Amanda Heller all over again.

95
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,640
You did the right thing.

98
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,480
Now, where is he?

101
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,920
Thomas.

104
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,800
Rachel. What are you doing here?

105
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,240
- I'm here to help you.
- Help me how?

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,480
First, put down the plate.

109
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,760
Drink this.

112
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,120
- What is that?
- Vodka.

113
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,360
Um, does Mom know that you're here?

116
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,760
- 'Cause it's probably past ten.
- Don't worry about it.

117
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,280
Just start from the beginning,
and tell us what happened.

120
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,920
Things were going so well.

121
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,440
Then what?

124
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,640
I think we should stop seeing each other.

125
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,760
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

128
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,520
- Did she say why?
- I mean, this thing- what are we doing?

129
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,600
I mean, is this normal?

132
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,560
Norm- I- I don't know. I don't care.
I'm happy. Aren't you happy?

133
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,280
- You're happy?
- You're not?

136
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,040
- All we do is argue.
- That is bullshit.

137
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,640
Maybe she was just in a bad mood.

140
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,640
Yeah, maybe like a- a hormonal thing.

141
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,240
- P.M.S.?
- What do you know about P.M.S.?

144
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,480
- More than you, Tom.
- Then what happened?

145
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,520
This can't come as a total surprise to you.

148
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,920
I mean, we've been like
Sid and Nancy for months now.

149
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,720
Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy
seven times with a kitchen knife.

152
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,880
I- I mean, we have some disagreements,
but I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious.

153
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,920
No. I'm Sid.

156
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,120
Oh, so I'm Nancy?

157
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,480
Let's just eat, and we'll talk about it later.

160
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,200
Mmm. That is good.

161
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,760
I'm really glad we did this.

164
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,840
I love these pancakes.

165
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,560
What?

168
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,080
Tom, don't go.
You're still my best friend!

169
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,720
-Jesus.
- You've broken up with girls before.

172
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,320
Yes.

173
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,120
And girls have broken up with you before.

176
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,280
- This is different.
- Why?

177
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,400
'Cause it's Summer.

180
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:28,120
So you'll- you'll meet somebody new.

181
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,120
Point is, you're the best guy I know.
You'll get over her.

184
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,720
I think it's kind of like how they say.
There's, uh-

185
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,680
There's plenty of other fish in the sea.

188
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,120
- No.
- They- They say that.

189
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,120
Well, they're lying.

192
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,640
I don't want to get over her.

193
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:47,000
I want to get her back.

196
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,440
Maybe playing it safe
is the wrong approach.

197
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,360
The nuclear family is dead...

200
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,000
and we need a new holiday
that recognizes that.

201
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,000
May twenty first.

204
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,440
Other Mother's Day.

205
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,880
Thank you.

208
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,200
I'd say we've got some potential here.
What do you think, Hansen?

209
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,000
Could you write up
some prototypes for these?

212
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,600
Uh, Mr. Vance, there's a telephone call
for you on line three.

213
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,160
Oh. Thank you. Uh, everyone,
this is Summer, my new assistant.

216
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,440
Summer just moved here from-

217
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,840
- Michigan.
- Right. Michigan. Right.

220
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,120
Uh, Summer, everyone.

221
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,200
everyone, Summer.
Excuse me. I have to take this.

224
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,920
it's nice to meet you all.

225
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,720
There's only
two kinds of people in the world.

228
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,800
There's women, and there's men.

229
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,920
Summer Finn was a woman.

232
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,560
Height, average. Weight, average.

233
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,480
Shoe size, slightly above average.

236
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,520
for all intents and purposes...

237
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,520
Summer Finn, just another girl.

240
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,440
Except she wasn't.

241
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,880
To wit, in nineteen ninety eight...

244
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,760
Summer quoted a song
by the Scottish band Belle and Sebastian...

245
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,680
in her high school yearbook.

248
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,240
"Color my life with the chaos of trouble."

249
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,160
This spike in Michigan sales
of their album...

250
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,160
This spike in Michigan sales
of their album...

251
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,320
The Boy with the Arab Strap...

254
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,720
continues to puzzle industry analysts.

255
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,560
Summer's employment at the Daily Freeze
during her sophomore year...

258
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,400
coincided with an inexplicable
Two hundred and twenty one percent increase in revenue.

261
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,560
every apartment Summer rented...

264
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,280
was offered at an average rate
of nine point two percent below market value.

265
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:29,720
And her round trip commute to work...

268
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,200
averaged eighteen point four double takes per day.

269
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,920
it was a rare quality, this "Summer effect."

272
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,800
Rare, and yet something
every adolescent male
has encountered...

273
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,720
at least once in their lives.

276
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,720
for Tom Hansen to find it now
in a city of four hundred thousand offices...

277
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:50,120
Ninety one thousand commercial buildings
and three point eight million people-

280
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,280
well, that could only
be explained by one thing

281
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,240
fate.

284
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,760
Dude, I hear she's a bitch.

285
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,520
Really?

288
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,560
Yeah. Patel tried to talk
to her in the copy room.
She's totally not having it.

289
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,160
Maybe she was just in a hurry.

292
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,920
And maybe she's an uppity,
"better than everyone" superskank.

293
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,000
- Damn.
- I know. She's pretty hot.

296
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,080
That sucks. Why is it pretty girls...

297
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,480
think they can treat people like crap
and get away with it?

300
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,560
Centuries of reinforcement.

301
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,000
You know what? Screw her. I don't care.

304
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,400
If she wants to be that way, fine.

311
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,000
# Driving in your car#

314
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,520
# Oh, please don't drop me home #

315
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,520
Smiths?

318
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,520
Hi.

319
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,360
- I love the Smiths.
- Sorry?

322
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,320
I said I love the Smiths.

325
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:04,760
You have- You have good taste in music.

328
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,720
- You like the Smiths?
- Yeah.

329
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,680
#To die by your side
is such a heavenly way to die #

332
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,280
- I love 'em.

333
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,240
Holy shit.

336
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,640
There you go. Have another piece.

337
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,120
- Ah.
- Drinks?

340
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,040
- Arthur, did you get a piece?
- Thanks.

341
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:32,240
Want one? Yeah.

344
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,520
- Want one?
- Mmm.

345
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,480
- Summer, right?
- Oh. Yeah.

348
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,080
- Smiths fan.
- Yeah. Tom.

349
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,400
Want some, uh, uh-

351
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,280
- It's not champagne.
I don't know what it is.
- Sure.

353
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,680
So, how's it going?

355
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,640
- Pretty good.
- You just moved here, right?

357
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:53,960
- Mm- hmm.
- When?

359
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,600
- Saturday.
- Oh, wow.

361
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,960
And, uh, what brought you?

364
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,360
Boredom mostly.

365
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,880
- Wanted to ty
something new and exciting.
- Mmm.

367
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
- Well, clearly you've
come to the right place.

371
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,520
- So, have you worked here long?
- About three or four years.

374
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,480
Wow. You've...

376
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,680
- always wanted to write greeting cards?

378
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:20,600
No, I don't even want to do it now.

379
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,840
Well, you should do something else then.

382
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah. I studied to be an architect, actually.

383
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,960
You did? That's cool.
What happened there?

386
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,960
It didn't work out.

387
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,840
I needed a job, and here we are.

390
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,440
You any good?

391
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,720
Well, um, I wrote this one.

392
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:39,720
Well, um, I wrote this one.

393
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
"Today you're a man.

396
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,480
Mazel tov on your bar mitzvah."

397
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,240
- It's a big seller.
- I meant as an architect.

400
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,800
Yeah.

401
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,880
- I doubt it.
- Well...

404
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,760
you're a perfectly adequate
greeting card writer.

405
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:59,480
Thank you.
That was actually my nickname in college.

408
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,400
They called me
"Perfectly Adequate" Hansen.

409
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,320
They used to call me Anal Girl.

412
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,040
I was very neat and organized.

413
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,080
- Well, I should get back, so-
- uh-

416
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,120
All right. See you later.

421
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,760
I don't know, man. I think it's official.

423
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:08,920
I'm in love with Summer.
I love her smile.

426
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,080
I love her hair. I love her knees.

427
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,320
I love this heart- shaped birthmark
she has on her neck.

430
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,720
I love the way she sometimes
licks her lips before she talks.

431
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,440
I love the sound of her laugh.

434
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,520
I love the way she looks
when she's sleeping.

437
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,360
# She's like the wind #

438
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,360
# She's like the wind #

439
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,080
I love how I hear this song
every- every time I think of her.

442
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,480
I love how she makes me feel.

443
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,400
Like-

446
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,480
Like anything's possible,
or like- I don't know. Like-

447
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,840
Like life is worth it.

449
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,120
This is not good.

452
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,040
She likes Magritte and Hopper.

453
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,480
And we talked about Banana fish
for like twenty minutes.

455
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,480
We're so compatible, it's insane.

458
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,720
She's- Well, she's not like I thought at all.
She's amazing.

459
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,240
- Oh, boy.
- What?

461
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,880
Just 'cause some cute girl
likes the same bizarro crap you do...

462
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,880
Just 'cause some cute girl
likes the same bizarro crap you do...

463
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,840
that doesn't make her
your soul mate, Tom.

466
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,720
- Red team wins!
- What do you mean?

467
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,120
- It's off.
- What?

470
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,040
- It's off.
- What?

471
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,960
- Me and Summer.
- Was it ever on?

474
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,040
No, but it could have been,
in a world where good things
happen to me.

475
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,200
- Yeah, well, that's not really where we live.
- No.

478
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
- Lucky.

479
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,840
So, what happened?

482
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,760
- All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

483
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,680
So there we are.
Nine more floors to ride, just me and her.

486
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,640
Hey, Summer.

487
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,640
Hi.

490
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,040
How was your weekend?

491
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,960
It was good.

494
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,720
Can you believe that shit?

495
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,680
I'm sorry. What shit?

498
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,480
- I think I missed something.
- She said, "It was good."
Emphasis on the "good."

499
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,880
She basically said she
spent the weekend having sex
with some guy she met at the gym.

502
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,040
Skank. Whatever. I'm over it.

503
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,800
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- She's not interested in me.

506
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,720
There's really nothing I can do about that.

507
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,000
-Just because she said it was good?
- And some other things.

510
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,240
Like, did she say, uh, "hey" instead of"hi"?

511
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,080
I mean, 'cause you know that that-
that means that she's a lesbian, right?

514
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,160
I gave her plenty of chances.

515
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,800
I'm going to the supply room.
Do you guys need anything?

518
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,440
I think you know what I need.

519
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,840
Uh, toner.

522
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,840
Okay. Sure. No problem.

527
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,880
- # Good times for a change #

530
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,680
- # See, the luck I've had #

531
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,280
# Can make a good man turn bad #

534
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,400
# So, please, please, please #

535
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,040
# Let me, let me, let me #

538
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,280
- # Let me get what I want ##

539
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,280
Whatever, man. It's fine. I don't need
this crap really. I just, you know-

542
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm comfortable. I'm unhassled.

543
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,400
People don't realize this, but loneliness-

546
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,960
- It's underrated.
- You could just ask her out.

547
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,880
Don't be stupid.

552
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,320
- This Friday, all you can karaoke
at the Mill.
- No.

553
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,360
- Come on.
- They're not gonna let you
back in there after last time.

556
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,520
Ah, I wasn't that bad.

557
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,480
Dude, you threw up on the stage,
you tried to fight the bartender...

560
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,400
and you threatened
to burn the place down.

562
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,120
- But I didn't burn the place down.
- We're not going back there, man.

563
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,680
Look. It's not like that, okay?
It's a work thing. The whole office is going.

566
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:40,120
- I can't go, even if I wanted-
- You're not listening to me.

567
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,480
- What?
- The whole office is going.

572
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,680
#Just like every cowboy #

573
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,600
# Sings a sad, sad song #

576
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,680
# every rose has its thorn ##

577
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:05,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

580
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,360
- They said you weren't coming.
- You asked if I was-

581
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,640
Goddamn. That song is brilliant!

584
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,600
- What's up, Hansen?
- Summer. Summer-

585
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,080
- That's me.
- Come on up.

588
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,240
- You

589
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,040
- Okay. I'm new, so no making fun of me.
Whoo!

592
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,400
- Thanks, chief.

593
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,320
- Ah, thanks.
- Yeah, man.

596
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,560
Cheers.

600
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,680
# I got some troubles, but they won't last #

601
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,680
# I'm gonna lay right down
here in the grass #

604
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,400
# And pretty soon
all my troubles will pass #

605
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,920
# 'Cause I'm in Su -Su -Su #

608
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,840
# Su- Su- Su #

609
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,240
# Su- Su- Su- Su- Su- Su #

612
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,440
# Sugar Town ##

619
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
- Like, that's what I was-
- I guess.

622
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,880
- Hello.
- Hi.

623
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,440
I didn't, uh-
I didn't know you were gonna join us.

625
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,600
I would have gotten you,
you know, a drink, or-

628
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,520
- I'm good.
- You're good?

629
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,560
- You- You were great-
great up, uh, singing.
- Thank you.

632
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,880
I wanted to sing "Born To Run,"
but they didn't have it.

633
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,800
- I love "Born To Run."
- Me too.

636
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,120
- Tom's from New Jersey.
- Really?

637
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,920
Yeah. I grew up there.
Uh, I lived there till I was twelve.

638
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,920
Yeah. I grew up there.
Uh, I lived there till I was twelve.

639
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,760
I named my cat after Springsteen.

642
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,680
No kidding. What- What was his name?

643
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,680
Bruce.

646
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,240
- oh.
- That makes sense.

650
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,680
So, do you have a boyfriend?

651
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,600
- No.
- Why not?

654
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,960
- 'Cause I don't want one.
- Come on. I don't believe that.

655
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:42,840
You don't believe that a woman
could enjoy being free and independent?

658
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,800
Are you a lesbian?

659
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,960
No, I'm not a lesbian.

662
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,160
I just don't feel comfortable
being anyone's girifriend.

663
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,720
I don't actually feel comfortable
being anyone's anything, you know.

666
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:55,160
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?

667
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:57,120
- Nope.

670
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,160
Okay. Let me break it down for you.

671
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,240
- Break it down.
- Okay. I like being on my own.

674
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:06,200
Relationships are messy,
and people's feelings get hurt.

675
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,400
Who needs it? We're young.

678
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,840
We live in one of the most
beautiful cities in the world.

679
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,080
Might as well have fun while we can and...

682
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,400
save the serious stuff for later.

683
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,600
Holy shit. You're a dude. She's a dude.

686
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,600
Okay. But wait, wait.
What happens if you fall in love?

687
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,520
- What?

690
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
Well, you don't believe that, do you?

691
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,760
It's love. It's not Santa Claus.

694
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,680
Well, what does that word even mean?

697
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,800
- Well, maybe that's-
- And most marriages end
in divorce these days.

700
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,080
- Like my parents.
- Okay. Mine too, but-

701
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,720
Methinks the lady doth protest too much.

704
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,920
The lady dothn't.

705
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,920
There's no such thing as love. It's a fantasy.

708
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:50,480
Well, I think you're wrong.

709
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,520
Okay. Well...

712
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,000
what is it that I'm missing then?

713
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,320
I think you know it when you feel it.

715
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,840
I guess we can just agree to disagree.

718
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,040
Yeah.

719
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,680
Okay. Who's singing next?

722
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,400
I nominate Young Werther here.

723
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,520
- I'm not nearly drunk enough to-
- Bartender.

726
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,520
- Whoo! Whoo!
- # Outside there's a boxcar waiting #

727
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,680
# Outside the family stew #

730
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,840
- # Out by the fire breathing #
- Whoo! Whoo!

731
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,800
# Outside we wait till our face turns blue #

734
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,680
# I know the nervous walking #

735
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,560
# I know the dirty beard ha- ha- hangs #

738
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,800
# Out by the boxcar waiting #

739
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,640
# Take me away to nowhere plains #

742
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:52,480
- #There is a wait so long #
- # So long, so long #

743
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:56,200
#There is a wait so long #

746
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,120
# Here comes your man #

747
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,800
- Whoo! You're good!
- # Here comes your man #

750
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,160
- # Here comes your man ##
- Is it-

751
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,040
- It's not?
- No, that's not it. 

754
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,960
- What is that then?
- I don't know. That-

755
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:15,160
- That- That's something, but that's not it.
- I know.

758
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:17,560
- Ah, I used to watch it every week.
- Oh. Yeah!

759
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,520
- It was the best show on TV.
- I know.

762
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,760
Knight Rider? Come on.
And the theme song is really good.

763
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,720
- So good.
- This is gonna bother me for a week.

766
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,640
Me too.

767
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,000
#And I'm proud to be an American #

770
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:32,680
# Where at least I know I'm free #

771
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,520
#And I'd like to entertain- #_

776
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,760
- You were amazing.
- I know, buddy.

777
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,680
- You're amazing.

780
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,600
- This was so much fun.
- Yeah.

781
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,800
You guys are so much- Wait! Wait! Hey.

784
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,160
- What's up?
- Not you.

785
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,120
- You.

788
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,760
- He likes you.
- Okay.

789
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,680
- He likes likes you!
- Good night, McKenzie.

792
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:57,600
- Why don't you just tell her, Tom?
- Yeah.

793
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,280
- You guys are the best!
- sorry you had to see that. He's-

796
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,520
Happens every time we come here.
He, uh- I don't know.

797
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,440
Something about that guy and singing.

800
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,440
- Is that true?
- Yeah, yeah.

801
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,400
He drinks, and he sings
and just loses his shit.

804
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,560
No, uh, not McKenzie.

805
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,560
Um, the other thing.

808
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,480
What thing?

809
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,440
Do you... like me?

812
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,560
Yeah.

813
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,560
Yeah, of course I like you.

816
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,360
As friends?

817
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,320
Right. As friends.

820
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,200
Just as friends?

821
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,520
Yeah. I mean, I- I don't know.
I hadn't really thought about, um-

824
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,760
Yes. Why?

825
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,040
No reason. I just-

828
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,440
I think you're interesting,
and I'd like for us to be friends.

829
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,520
Is that all right?

832
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,040
Yeah. It's, um-

833
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,040
- Yeah. You and me. We should be friends.
- Mmm.

836
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,040
Okay. Good.

837
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,640
Well, I'm that way, so-

840
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,520
- Okay. Well, good night.
- Good night.

841
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,640
- Hey.
- Hi.

848
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,840
So, that was fun the other night.

856
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,520
- You son of a bitch.
- shh!

857
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,400
- The same girl you've been
obsessing over for weeks now?
- I've not been obsessing.

860
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,880
The girl you said was out of your league,
that you'd never have a chance with.

861
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,040
- That girl.
- Paul, seriously.

863
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,560
- Did you bang her?
- No.

866
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,280
- What, hum job? Hand job?
- Man, no.

867
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,680
No jobs. I'm still unemployed.
We- We kissed.

870
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,400
Level with me, man. Come on.
This is your best friend, huh?

871
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,840
Your best friend who tolerated you
whining about this girl for weeks on end.

874
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
- Paul-
- You were essentially stalking her!

875
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,720
- Paul! Shh!

880
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,040
- Hi.
- Hey.

881
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,320
- I'm Summer.
- Summer.


884
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,560
- I'm Paul.
- Hi, Paul. Nice to meet you.

885
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:29,040
Well, I gotta go. I gotta do some, you know.

888
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,960
- Yeah, man.
- Um, pretend I was never here.

889
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:34,680
Oh, wait! Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.
Um, if any jobs come up-

892
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,040
Thanks, Paul! See ya!

896
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,360
He's, uh, you know, an old friend.

897
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,600
If you heard any of, um-

900
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,920
- Heard what?
- Nothing. You wanna go?

901
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,560
Yeah. I'm stalking. I mean, I'm starving.

904
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,160
- Ah, hon?

905
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:00,080
Our sink is broken.

908
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:07,480
Man, all of our sinks are broken.

909
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,440
What are we looking for again?

910
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,440
What are we looking for again?

911
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,560
- Uh, trivets.
- How 'bout a fly gel?

914
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,640
No, I don't think so.

916
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:23,600
- No? You don't want a fly gel?

917
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,600
Home sweet home.

920
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,440
Our place really is lovely, isn't it?

921
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,360
Yes.

924
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,440
Ooh! ldol's on.

925
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,080
- The TV's not working.

928
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,320
Oh.

929
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,000
Well, I'm famished.

932
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,920
Let's eat.

936
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:59,680
Mmm. Smells delicious.

937
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,600
Oh, honey, that's because it is delicious.

940
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,640
I made it myself.

941
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:08,920
- Bald eagle.
- Your favorite.

944
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:11,280
- Mm -hmm.

945
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:18,680
The sink's broken.

948
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,800
Well, that's okay, because...

949
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,240
that's why we bought
a home with two kitchens.

952
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:27,560
You're so smart.

953
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,880
I'll race you to the bedroom.

956
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,600
# Left behind #

957
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,560
#There goes the fear again #

962
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,720
#There goes the fear #_

966
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,640
Darling, I don't know how to tell you this...

967
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:56,800
but... there's a Chinese family
in our bathroom.

975
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,440
This is fun.

978
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,000
- You're fun.

979
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,920
Thanks.

982
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,160
Hey, um...

983
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,360
I just wanna tell you that, um...

986
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,400
I'm not really looking...

987
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,960
for anything... serious.

990
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,200
Is that okay?

991
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:44,120
Yeah.

994
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,080
'Cause some people kind of freak out
when they hear that.

995
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,600
No, not me.

998
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,920
You sure?

999
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,760
Yeah. Like, casual. Right? Take it slow.

1002
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,760
Right.

1003
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,760
No pressure.

1008
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:36,000
Can you, uh- Can you wait one second?

1012
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,880
Okay. Settle. She's just a girl.

1013
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,880
Just a girl.

1016
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,960
She wants to keep it casual which is why she's in my bed right now.

1020
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,520
But that's casual.
That's what casual people do.

1021
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:00,240
That's fine. That's great.

1024
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,280
- Hi.
- Hi.

1028
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,040
# What I want you've got
and it might be hard to handle #

1029
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,240
# Like the flame that burns the candle #

1032
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,280
#The candle feeds the flame #

1033
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,320
# Yeah, yeah, what I've got full stock #

1035
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,600
- # of thoughts and dreams that scatter#

1038
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,760
# You pull them all together #

1039
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,120
#And I can't explain
Oh, yeah #

1042
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,640
- # Well, well, you #
- Hey.

1043
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,560
- # Ooh -ooh, ooh, ooh -ooh #
- Hello.

1046
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,480
#You make my dreams come true #

1047
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,120
- # Ooh -ooh, ooh, ooh -ooh #
- Hi.

1050
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,000
- # Ooh -ooh #
- # Well, well, well, you #

1051
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,720
- # Ooh- ooh, ooh, ooh- ooh #
- # Oh, yeah #

1054
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,920
- # You make my dreams come true #
- Thanks.

1055
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,240
- # Ooh-ooh, you, ooh- ooh #
- # Yeah, oh, yeah #

1058
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:04,680
# You #

1059
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,520
# On a night when bad dreams
become a screamer#

1062
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,440
- # When they're messin'
with the dreamer#

1063
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,920
# I can laugh it in the face #

1066
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,080
#Twist and shout my way out #

1067
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,520
# And wrap yourself around me #

1070
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,320
# 'Cause I ain't the way you found me #

1071
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,760
# And I'll never be the same
Oh, yeah #

1074
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,880
# Well, well, you #

1075
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,520
#You make my dreams come true #

1078
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,280
- # Ooh- ooh, you, ooh- ooh #
- # Whoa, yeah #

1079
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,040
- # Ooh- ooh #
- # Well, well, well, you #

1082
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,720
- # Ooh- ooh, ooh, ooh- ooh #
- # Whoo- whoo #

1083
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,040
#You make my dreams come true #

1086
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,840
- # Ooh- ooh, you, ooh- ooh #

1087
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,760
- # Oh- oh- oh, yeah #
- # Ooh- ooh #

1090
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,160
# Now listen to this #

1091
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,480
# I'm down on my daydream #

1094
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:57,560
- # Oh, that sleepwalk
should be over by now #

1095
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,520
# Oh, no #

1098
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,680
# Yeah, you #

1099
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,200
#Yeah #_

1106
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,120
You know, I'm gonna- I'm gonna-
I'm gonna get Aifredo's number.

1107
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,040
- Okay.
- And I'll- And I'll bring it to you.

1110
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,040
- Okay.
- Okay?

1111
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,200
Is this Solitaire?

1114
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,800
So, did you get her back yet or what?

1115
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,320
Working on it.

1118
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,480
- Hey, maybe you should write a book.
- What?

1119
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,200
Well, you know, Heny Miller said
the best way to get over a woman...

1122
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,200
is to turn her into literature.

1123
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,000
Well, that guy had a lot more sex than me.

1128
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,200
Oh, this is it! This is it!

1129
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:51,160
So great to hear from you.

1132
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,160
I can't this week, but maybe next?

1133
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,240
I hope this means
you're ready to be friends.

1140
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,880
Yeah, that's it. That is it.

1141
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,360
Your girl is losing it.

1144"
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,840
Can you just be serious, for just a second?

1145
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
- I am being totally serious.
- No, you're joking around.

1148
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,600
- No, I am not joking around.
- "Octopus's Garden"?

1149
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,200
Yes, "Octopus's Garden"
is the best Beatles song ever recorded.

1152
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,960
Why don't you just say "Piggies"?

1153
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,040
Come on. I love Ringo Starr!

1156
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,640
- Nobody loves Ringo Starr.
- That's what I love about him.

1157
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,720
- No, no.

1159
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,680
Ooh, this looks good.

1162
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,920
Gets really good reviews.

1166
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,400
You know what?
That looks pretty doable.

1167
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:55,240
- Why are you asking me now?
- Because this was your idea.

1172
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,160
- Put your hand there.
- Wait one second.

1173
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:03,160
- Okay. Three, two, one!
- One.

1178
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,720
Yeah, the street level isn't so exciting, but-

1179
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,200
- Like, if you look up-
# Sweet #

1182
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,000
# Disposition #

1183
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,120
The fineArts Building.

1186
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,640
The guys who designed this, Walker
and Eisen, are... two of my favorites.

1187
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,520
- # Never #
- Isn't that cool?

1190
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,080
# Too soon ##

1191
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,040
- This is my favorite spot.
- This is?

1194
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,360
This is your favorite spot?

1195
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,600
Right here.

1198
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,480
How come?

1199
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,600
Uh, I don't know.
It's kind of hard to explain, I guess.

1202
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,320
Well, try.

1203
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,000
Um- Well, okay.

1206
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:03,760
Like, that building- that's, uh-

1207
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,440
That's been there since nineteen eleven.

1210
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,520
And that- that's the Continental.
That's LA's first skyscraper.

1211
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:11,880
It was built in nineteen o four.

1214
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,560
What is that?

1215
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,640
That?

1218
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,640
- That's a parking lot.
- oh!

1219
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,040
Yeah. That's- That's also a parking lot.

1222
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,600
That's, um- Yeah.

1223
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:28,160
There's a lot of beautiful stuff
here too though.

1226
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't know.
I just... wish people would notice it more.

1227
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,840
if it were me, then, uh-

1230
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,160
if it were you what?

1231
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,200
I don't know. I think I'd... make 'em notice.

1234
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,400
How would you make them notice?

1235
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:53,240
I don't know.
There's a lot of different stuff you could do.

1238
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,680
Show me.

1239
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,280
- Please. I don't know
anything about architecture.

1242
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,000
- You want me to draw you something?
- Yeah.

1243
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,320
- I don't have any paper.
- Well, use my arm.

1245
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,400
Please, I need a tattoo.

1248
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,880
- Well, let's see your arm.
- That's the spirit.

1249
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,240
Well, the buildings
need to be integrated better, so-

1252
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,120
You could maximize light capacity here.

1253
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,440
It's kind of messy.

1256
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:49,440
That's okay.

1260
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,840
For Tom Hansen, this was
the night where everything changed.

1261
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,120
That wall Summer so often hid behind-

1264
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,600
the wall of distance, of space, of casual-

1265
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,720
that wall was slowly coming down.

1268
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,320
for here was Tom, in her world...

1269
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,640
a place few had been invited to see
with their own eyes.

1272
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,880
And here was Summer, wanting him there.

1273
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,600
Him, no one else.

1276
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,840
- Have you ever been in a tornado?
- No.

1277
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,520
- It's that and my teeth falling out.

1280
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,440
- I have that too!
- You do?

1281
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:39,760
Yeah! It's so weird.
It's like being an old man.

1284
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,480
What else do you have?

1285
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,520
Um, earthquakes?

1288
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,760
- Really?
- No.

1292
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,160
You know, I dream sometimes about flying.

1293
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,080
It starts out like
I'm running really, really fast.

1296
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm, like, superhuman.

1297
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,280
And the terrain starts
to get really rocky and steep.

1300
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,000
And then I'm running so fast
that my feet aren't even
touching the ground.

1301
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,520
And I'm floating,
and it's like this amazing, amazing realness.

1304
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,200
I'm free. I'm safe.

1305
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,000
Then I realize...

1308
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:19,640
I'm completely alone.

1309
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,840
And then I wake up.

1312
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,840
As he listened, Tom began to realize...

1313
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,200
that these weren't stories routinely told.

1316
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,520
- These were stories one had to earn.

1317
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:36,440
He could feel the wall coming down.

1320
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:39,720
He wondered if anyone else
had made it this far.

1321
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,640
Which is why the next six words
changed everything.

1324
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,600
I've never told anybody that before.

1325
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,440
I guess I'm not just anybody.

1328
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:54,880
- So what are you exactly?

1329
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,880
- I don't know.
- Are you her boyfriend?

1332
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,040
- It's not that simple.
- Sure, it is.

1333
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:01,200
What, like, are we going steady?
Come on, guys.

1336
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,800
You know, we're- we're adults.
We know how we feel.

1337
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,760
We don't need to put labels on it.

1340
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,680
I mean, "boyfriend," "girlfriend."

1341
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,160
All that stuff is- It's really juvenile.

1344
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,560
- You sound gay.
- You really do.

1345
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:15,480
Okay, first of all...

1348
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,400
your last girlfriend was Amy Sussman
in the seventh grade...

1349
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:22,040
and you dated for, like, three hours.

1352
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,880
And you you've been with Robyn
since what- like nineteen ninety eight?

1353
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,320
- 'ninety seven.
- 'ninety seven. See-

1356
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,000
- Shoot.

1357
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,200
I don't think the two of you are exactly
authorities on modern relationships.

1360
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,480
- So, what should I do?
- You should ask her.

1361
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:46,400
- What?

1364
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:49,040
Well, why rock the boat,
is what I'm thinking.

1365
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:51,000
I mean, things are going well.

1368
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:53,560
You start putting labels on it,
that's like the kiss of death.

1369
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:57,320
- It's like saying, "I love you."
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

1372
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,160
That's what happened
between me and Sean.

1373
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,760
- Who the hell's Sean?
- My boyfriend before Mark.

1376
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,080
Who the- Never mind.

1377
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:08,760
- So, what you're saying-
- I'm saying you do want to ask her.

1380
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,880
It's obvious. You're just afraid
you'll get an answer you don't want...

1381
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,880
which will shatter all the illusions of how
great these past few months have been.

1384
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,800
Now look, if it were me...

1385
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,240
I'd find out now before you
show up at her place...

1388
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,120
and, well, she's in bed
with Lars from Norway.

1389
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:26,880
- Who's Lars from Norway?

1392
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,800
Just some guy she met at the gym...

1393
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,240
with Brad Pitt's face and Jesus' abs.

1395
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:36,600
- Wait! No, Coach. We're not done here.

1398
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:38,600
- Rachel!
- Look, it's easy, Tom.

1399
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:40,600
Just don't be a pussy.

1406
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,200
You okay?

1407
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,280
- Yeah.
- You sure?

1410
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,920
Summer, I gotta ask you something.

1411
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,920
- What?
- What are we, um-

1414
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,560
- What are we doing?
- I thought we were going to the movies.

1415
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,920
Yeah. Nah, I mean, like, what are we, like-

1418
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,560
What's going on here, with us?

1419
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,480
I don't know.

1420
00:41:16,679 --> 00:41:18,480
I don't know.

1421
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
Who cares?

1424
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,880
- I'm happy. Aren't you happy?
- Yeah.

1425
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,800
Good.

1436
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,120
London, nineteen sixty four.

1437
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:05,080
Those girls knew how to dress.

1440
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:08,600
Nowadays, it's all these giant sunglasses...

1441
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:10,840
and tattoos.

1444
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,040
It's handbags with little dogs in them.

1445
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:16,960
- Who okayed this?
- Some people like it.

1448
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:20,600
I like how you dress.

1449
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:24,080
I was thinking about
getting a butterfly tattoo
about yea big on my ankle.

1452
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:26,040
- No.

1453
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,800
Oh.

1454
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,800
Oh.

1455
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,040
Yo.

1458
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,960
How's it going?

1459
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:34,120
Uh, okay.

1462
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:36,360
You live around here?

1463
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,520
Um, yeah, not too far.

1466
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,760
I've never seen you here before.

1467
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,920
You're not too observant.

1470
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:45,880
That's funny. You're funny.

1471
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,360
- So let me buy you a drink.
- No, thank you.

1474
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:52,560
- You with this guy?
- Hey, I'm Tom.

1475
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:55,120
Whatever. So, come on.
One drink. What are you drinking?

1478
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,240
I said no, thanks.

1479
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,160
You're serious? This guy?

1482
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,160
- Hey, buddy-
- You know what? Don't be rude.

1483
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,160
I'm flattered, but I'm not interested.

1486
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,080
So why don't you go over there
and leave us alone? Thanks.

1487
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:10,920
It's a free country.

1492
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,600
I can't believe this is your boyfriend.

1493
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,280
What are you doing?

1494
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:31,280
What are you doing?

1497
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,120
It was really just a crazy thing.

1500
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,440
It happened like-
It felt like it happened fast, but really...

1501
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:42,480
it- it also felt like
it was happening really slowly...

1504
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,440
like everything all was just-

1505
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,040
- I don't know. It doesn't
feel like you think it would-

1508
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,680
Hey, what's the matter?

1509
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,560
I just- I can't believe you.

1512
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:55,800
You can't believe me?

1513
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,520
You were so completely,
completely uncool in there.

1516
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,520
Wait. Are you mad at me?
I just got my ass kicked for you.

1517
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,760
Oh, really? Was that for me?
Was that for my benefit?

1520
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,440
Yes, it was.

1521
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:08,760
Okay, well, next time don't,
'cause I don't need your help.

1524
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,200
You know what? I'm really tired.

1525
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,000
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

1532
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,240
No. You know what?

1533
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,600
I'm not going anywhere
till you tell me what's going on.

1536
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,600
Nothing's going on.

1537
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:40,480
We're just-

1540
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,680
What? We're just what?

1541
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,360
- We're just friends.
- No! Don't pull that with me!

1544
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,360
Don't even try to-

1545
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,680
This is not how you treat your friend.

1548
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,640
Kissing in the copy room?
Holding hands in IKEA?

1549
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,440
Shower sex? Come on! Friends, my balls!

1552
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:09,000
I like you, Tom.
I just don't want a relationship-

1553
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,480
Well, you're not the only one
that gets a say in this?

1556
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,480
I do too! And I say
we're a couple, goddamn it!

1559
00:45:20,679 --> 00:45:22,600
After you, please.

1570
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:35,920
I shouldn't have done that.

1571
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:40,280
- Done what?
- Gotten mad at you.

1574
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,240
I'm sorry.

1575
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,000
Look, we don't have to put a label on it.

1578
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:51,960
That's fine. I get it.

1579
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,000
But, you know,
I just- I need some consistency.

1582
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,400
I know.

1583
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:00,360
I need to know that
you're not gonna wake up in the morning...

1585
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,920
and... feel differently.

1588
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:12,280
- And I can't give you that.

1589
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,240
Nobody can.

1596
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,320
That hurt? I'm sorry.

1597
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,800
No, it doesn't hurt.

1600
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,120
- I like you.

1601
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:34,000
- All right.

1603
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,680
# You loved her
You were kissing #

1606
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,040
Shh. Well, what about you?
Did you ever even have a boyfriend?

1607
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,960
- Well, of course.
- Yeah?

1610
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:53,960
- Yeah.
- Well, tell me about them.

1611
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,880
- No.
- Oh? Why not?

1614
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,160
Because it's not important.

1615
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,600
I'm interested.

1620
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:05,680
All right. Fine. You want to go there?

1621
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,840
- Yeah. I can take it.
- Fine.

1624
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,240
So-

1625
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:16,280
Well, in high school there was Markus.

1628
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,520
- Quarterback slash homecoming king?

1629
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:21,000
No. He was a rower.

1632
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,040
He was very hot.

1636
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,440
For a brief time in college
there was, um- there was Charlie.

1637
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,720
She was nice, but-

1640
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,400
And then there was my semester in Sienna.

1641
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,400
Fernando Belardelli.

1644
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,800
Also known as "The Puma."

1645
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,200
- The puma?
- Yeah, The Puma, 'cause, you know.

1648
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:52,760
So-

1649
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,960
- Oh, that's it?
- The ones that lasted, yeah.

1652
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,360
What happened?
Why- Why didn't they work out?

1653
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,160
What always happens. Life.

1657
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:08,600
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

1660
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:11,520
No, it's not. It's awesome. Trust me.

1661
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:13,480
I'm serious.

1664
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,520
I'll go first.

1665
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:20,800
Penis.

1668
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:30,840
Penis.

1669
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,080
- penis!
- penis!

1672
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:35,000
- Penis!
- There's kids around.

1673
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:37,400
- There are no kids around.

1675
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:39,600
- penis!
- penis!

1678
00:49:39,719 --> 00:49:41,720
- You having fun?
- Yeah.

1679
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,040
This is the kind of thing you did
with The Puma, isn't it?

1682
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:47,240
Oh, we rarely left the room.

1683
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,840
Penis!

1686
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,040
- sorry. Tourette's. You know how it is.
- Penis!

1687
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:54,040
- She has it too. Penis!
- Penis!

1690
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,440
- Shh. everyone's looking over here.
- I'm done. I'm done.

1691
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,120
- Are you done?
- I'm done.

1694
00:49:59,239 --> 00:50:00,720
- You're done?
- Yeah.

1695
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,840
- This is too much.
- Unleash me. I'm done.

1698
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,840
- Promise?
- I promise.

1699
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,120
I promise.

1702
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:10,360
Penis!

1706
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,840
- It's very complex.
- Mmm.

1707
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,880
In a way, it sort of, like...

1710
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,600
says... so much...

1711
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:35,400
by...

1714
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:37,640
saying so little.

1715
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,600
- Do you want to go to the movies?
- Yep.

1723
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:45,880
- Suffering.

1726
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,440
- So much suffering.

1727
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,200
- Suffering.
- Suffering.

1737
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,880
T-Tom?

1740
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,360
Mr. Vance would like
to see you in his office.

1741
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,040
- Tom.

1744
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:40,160
Have a seat.

1748
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,440
Has something happened to you recently?

1749
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,440
What do you mean?

1752
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,800
A death in the family, someone taken ill-
Anything like that.

1753
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,760
No.

1756
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,360
Look, I don't mean to pry, but...

1757
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,480
does this have something to do
with Summer leaving?

1760
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,560
- Who?
- My assistant.

1761
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,600
- Your, um-
- Tom, everyone knows.

1764
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,720
Never mind.

1765
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,520
The reason I'm asking is,
lately your work performance...

1768
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,240
has been... a little off.

1769
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:20,120
- I'm not following.
- Okay.

1772
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,560
Um, here's something
that you wrote last week.

1773
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:25,640
Uh, "Roses are red, violets are blue.

1776
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,880
Fuck you, whore."

1777
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,640
Now, most shoppers at Valentine's Day-

1780
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,440
- Mr. Vance, are you firing me?
- No. No.

1781
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:36,440
Relax, Hansen.
You're one of the good ones.

1784
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,080
Okay. Uh, yeah, I'm sorry.

1785
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,080
Things have been a little difficult.

1788
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:44,360
That's okay. I completely understand that.

1789
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,680
I'm just saying that perhaps
you could channel those energies...

1792
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,960
um, into something like this.

1793
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:57,360
Funerals and sympathy.

1796
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,680
Misery, sadness, loss of faith...

1797
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
no reason to live.

1800
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,280
This is perfect for you.

1801
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,760
- uh-
- Good. Okay.

1804
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,120
Now back to work you go.

1805
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,680
Thank you.

1808
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,640
Thank you.

1809
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:33,320
- Hey.
- Hey.

1812
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,920
- Don't you have, like,
Twenty cards to write by Friday?
- Nope. All done.

1813
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,880
Really? Can you help me? 'Cause I've
run out of ways to say "congrats."

1816
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,520
Okay. I got "Good job,"
"Well done" and "Way to go."

1817
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:44,200
That's it.

1820
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,200
How 'bout,
"every day you make me proud...

1821
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:51,160
but today you get a card."

1824
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,640
- Shit, that's good!
- I know.

1825
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,920
Haye you tried "Merry"?

1828
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:01,200
- Wow! That's perfect! Merry!
- Wow!

1829
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,200
We've been stuck on this for an hour.

1832
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:07,400
Hmm. How about...

1833
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,520
"I love us"?

1836
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:16,000
Aw .

1837
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,480
I hate Summer.

1840
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:21,560
I hate her crooked teeth.

1841
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:23,280
I hate her nineteen sixties haircut.

1844
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,000
I hate her knobby knees.

1845
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:27,800
And I hate her
cockroach- shaped splotch on her neck.

1848
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,680
I hate the way she smacks her lips
before she talks.

1849
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,160
And I hate the way she sounds
when she laughs.

1852
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,480
# She's like the wind #

1853
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,480
I hate this song!

1856
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,120
Son, you're gonna have to exit the vehicle.

1857
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:46,280
I normally don't do blind dates...

1860
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,240
but Paul and Robyn
spoke very highly of you.

1861
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,640
- Ah.
- They said you write greeting cards.

1864
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,680
That's so interesting.
I wanted to write.

1865
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,960
I actually majored in English in college...

1868
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,920
but what are you gonna do
with that degree?

1869
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:00,080
- I went to Brown. Where did you go?
- Alison.

1872
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:02,000
Hmm?

1873
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:04,280
Listen, it's great to meet you...

1876
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,640
and... you're a very attractive girl.

1877
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,560
I just wanted to say up front that this isn't-

1880
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:13,000
- It's not gonna go anywhere.
- oh.

1881
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,600
I liked this girl. I mean, I loved her.

1884
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:18,520
What does she do?

1887
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:24,520
- Literally.
- Literally?

1890
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:28,600
Not literally. That's disgusting. Jesus.

1891
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:30,840
What's the matter with you?

1894
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,760
The point is...

1895
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:36,080
I'm messed up. I am.

1898
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:38,320
You know, on the one hand,
I want to forget her.

1899
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,240
On the other hand...

1902
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,440
I know that she's the only person in the
entire universe that will make me happy.

1903
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:46,440
- Mm- hmm.
- You ever do this?

1906
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,960
You think back
on the times you had with someone,
replay it in your head over and over again...

1907
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:54,200
and you look for those first signs of trouble.

1910
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:58,600
There's two options really.

1911
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,600
Either... she's an evil...

1914
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:04,840
emotionless, miserable human being...

1915
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,840
or... she's a robot.

1918
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,840
Small Wonder You know, Vicki.

1919
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,800
- That would explain a lot actually.
- Can I ask you a question?

1922
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,240
- Yeah.
- She never cheated on you?

1923
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,480
- No. Never.
- She ever take advantage
of you in any way?

1926
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,400
No.

1927
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,400
And she told you up front
that she didn't want a boyfriend.

1930
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,880
Yeah.

1931
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:37,560
I got a great idea.

1936
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:41,400
# Well, some things you can explain away #

1937
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:44,760
# But my heartache's in me every day #

1940
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,600
# Did you stand by me
No, not at all #

1941
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:50,520
# Di... ##

1944
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:53,480
Oh, fine! Go! That's fine. See ya.

1945
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,520
Waste of time.
You don't look anything like Summer.

1948
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:01,880
Now departing on Track 2,
Pacific Surfliner.

1949
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,080
full service to Santa Barbara.

1952
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:06,000
All aboard, please.

1953
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:15,000
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, you here?

1956
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,960
- Hell no.
- What do you mean, "Hell no"?

1957
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:19,520
- I'm not going to that.
- Yes, you are.

1960
00:58:19,639 --> 00:58:21,520
No, man. It's gonna be all old people.

1961
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:23,880
Yeah, but you said you were going.
That's why I'm going.

1964
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,680
And that's why I called her last night,
told her I was sick.

1965
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:30,040
- Like a ninja.
- Dude! I'm gonna- I'm not gonna
know anybody at this thing.

1968
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:32,480
Maybe you'll meet
some hot granddaughters or something.

1969
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:34,480
- I'm hanging up now.
- Bye, baby.

1972
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:37,840
May I have your attention, please?

1973
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,120
Passengers boarding the train
in Los Angeles, please...

1976
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:42,560
have your tickets out
and ready for collection.

1980
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:14,520
Hi, Tom!

1981
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:16,920
Hey. Summer.

1984
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:20,600
- I must have walked right by you.
- Yeah.

1985
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:23,600
Well, um, what are you doing?
Are you going to Millie's?

1988
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,800
- Me too.
- Cool.

1989
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,320
- I forgot you knew her.
- Yeah, we worked together
all that time, so-

1992
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,760
- of course.
- I love Millie. She's the sweetest.

1993
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,760
She is.

1996
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,080
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1997
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:41,320
Good. I- I wrote to you.
I never heard back, but-

2000
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,760
Yeah. Yeah.
sorry about that. I- I just, you know-

2001
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,000
It got kind of crazy,
and the holidays came up, so work was-

2004
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,400
You still working for Vance?

2005
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:51,240
Yeah.

2008
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:55,320
Well, I was gonna
go get a coffee if you wanna-

2009
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,960
"The Architecture of Happiness."

2012
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,120
- Yeah.
- That looks like a good book.

2013
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:04,200
Yeah, it's-

2016
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,240
- Well, I don't want to bother you.
- No, no. I, um-

2017
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,600
Yeah, let's get coffee.

2020
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:12,520
After you.

2021
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:19,640
 # Sweet #

2024
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:26,200
# Disposition #

2025
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:36,600
# Never #

2028
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:42,000
# Too soon #

2029
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:47,800
#A moment, a love
A dream aloud #

2032
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,560
#A kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs #

2033
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:54,360
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

2036
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,280
- So do you.
- # Sweet #

2037
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,520
- Well?
- # Disposition ##

2038
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,520
- Well?
- # Disposition ##

2039
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:06,880
Penis.

2042
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,280
No.

2043
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,760
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

2046
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,000
You may kiss the bride.

2047
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,320
# Helping the kids out of their coats #

2050
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,080
# Wait, the babies haven't been born #

2051
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:24,920
# Oh, oh, oh- oh- oh- oh, oh #

2054
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:27,880
# Unpacking the bags and setting up #

2055
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,680
# And planting lilacs and buttercups #

2057
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,400
- Okay. What else you got?

2060
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:35,520
- Well, you snore.
- No, I don't.

2061
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:37,760
- You do.
- No, I don't.

2064
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,680
- Yeah.
- Well, you do too.

2065
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,000
- Oh, I definitely do.
- And your feet reek.

2068
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,000
- That one time!
- No, every time.

2069
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,920
- That one time!
- No.

2072
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:49,080
That one time especially, but every time.

2073
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,200
And when you wake up,
your hair, it sticks up like that.

2076
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:55,240
- It's ridiculous.
- You're ridiculous.

2077
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,200
Your favorite Beatle is Ringo.

2080
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,440
Damn right!

2081
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:01,640
- Ringo's the best.
- Ringo is-

2084
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,360
- Goose!
- oh! oh! oh!

2085
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:08,440
Man! He's fast. Damn! All right.

2088
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,400
You got me. Duck.

2089
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:12,680
- Duck.

2092
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:18,480
#At last #

2093
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:23,240
# My love has come along #

2096
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,120
# My lonely days are over#

2097
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:30,120
One, two, three.

2100
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:36,920
- #And life is like a song #

2101
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,840
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah.

2104
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,760
Okay.

2105
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,440
# Oh, at last #

2108
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:50,200
- #The skies above are blue #
- Hey, I was wondering, um-

2109
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:54,760
I was gonna maybe
have a party on Friday, um...

2112
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,000
on our rooftop
that has, like, a really nice garden...

2113
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,040
if you want to come.

2116
01:03:01,159 --> 01:03:03,000
- Yeah.
- # For you are mine #

2117
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,360
if you're not busy.

2120
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:08,360
- # At last #
- I don't think I will be.

2124
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:14,720
- They're good, huh?
- They are good.

2128
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,280
I guess I just got lucky.

2129
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,600
Um, we met in elementary school.

2132
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:49,520
In seventh grade
we had the same class schedule...

2133
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:51,640
and, uh...

2136
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,920
we just clicked, you know?

2137
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,560
Love?

2140
01:03:56,679 --> 01:03:58,240
Shit, I don't know.

2141
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,600
As long as she's cute
and she's willing, right?

2144
01:04:01,719 --> 01:04:05,080
I'm flexible on the cute, so-

2145
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:07,640
Twenty one years.

2148
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,680
She's the light that guides me home.

2149
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,720
Yes, that is from one of our cards.

2152
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,760
No. Someone else wrote it.

2153
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:18,040
Doesn't make it less true.

2156
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:20,640
I think technically the "girl of my dreams"...

2157
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,240
would probably have, like,
a really bodacious rack, you know.

2160
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,640
Maybe different hair.

2161
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:30,120
Probably- You know, she'd probably be
a little more into sports.

2164
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,400
But, um, truthfully...

2165
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:37,080
Robyn's- Robyn's better
than the girl of my dreams.

2168
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:39,480
She's real.

2171
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:55,800
# He never, ever saw it coming at all #

2174
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,760
- # Never, ever saw it coming at all #

2175
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:01,760
Tom walked to her apartment...

2178
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,600
intoxicated by the promise of the evening.

2179
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:07,320
- # It's all right, it's all right #
- He believed that this time...

2182
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,080
his expectations would align with reality.

2183
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:12,400
# It's all right #

2186
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,680
# Hey, open wide
Here comes original sin #

2187
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,000
- Hi.
- Hey.

2190
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,840
- # Hey, open wide
Here comes original sin #
-You look nice.

2191
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,560
Yeah. Thanks.

2194
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:33,240
- I like your tie. Wow!
- Hi.

2195
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:34,880
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

2198
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,080
- Good.
- # It's all right, it's all right #

2199
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,360
# It's all right, it's all right, it's all right #

2202
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,560
# It's all right #

2203
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:47,200
- # No one's got it all #
- I, um, brought you something.

2206
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,720
- # No one's got it all #
- That's so nice.

2207
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,800
- # No one's got it all #
- Thank you.

2210
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,400
- You shouldn't have. That's so nice.
- It's the-

2211
01:05:57,519 --> 01:05:59,320
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

2214
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,320
- I'm excited to read it.
- Yeah.

2215
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,280
Come on.

2218
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,360
# And we're going to these meetings #

2219
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,240
- So, Tom, what is it that you do?
- Uh, I write greeting cards.

2222
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,920
Tom could be a really great architect
if he wanted to be.

2223
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:14,040
That's unusual.

2226
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:16,120
I mean, what made you go
from one to the other?

2227
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:18,360
I guess I just figured...

2230
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,000
why make something disposable,
like a building...

2231
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,840
when you can make something
that lasts forever, like a greeting card?

2236
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,320
# It's all right, it's all right #

2237
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,120
# It's all right, it's all right #

2240
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:34,360
- # It's all right, it's all right #

2241
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,400
- What?
- # It's all right #

2244
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:40,920
- # No one's got it all #
- Do you guys know each other?

2245
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,440
# No one's got it all #

2248
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:47,600
# No one's got it all #

2249
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:51,520
# Power to the people
We don't want it #

2252
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:54,680
# We want pleasure
And the TVs try to rape us #

2253
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,040
# And I guess that they're succeeding #

2256
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:59,000
# And we're going to these meetings #

2257
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,280
# But we're not doing any meeting #

2260
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,200
#And we're trying to be faithful #

2261
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:07,120
# But we're cheating, cheating, cheating #

2264
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:11,680
# I'm the hero of the story
Don't need to be saved #

2267
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:20,400
# I'm the hero of the story
Don't need to be saved #

2270
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:24,760
# I'm the hero of the story
Don't need to be saved #

2271
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,040
# It's all right #

2274
01:07:27,159 --> 01:07:30,520
# It's all right, it's all right, it's all right #

2275
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:33,200
# It's all right, it's all right #

2278
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,800
# It's all right, it's all right, it's all right #

2279
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,760
# It's all right, it's all right #

2282
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,600
# No one's got it all #

2285
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:51,600
# No one's got it all #

2288
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:53,920
#All, all #

2289
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,920
#All, all #_

2297
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,760
# Hung up and bent on a stranger #

2300
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:23,800
#Just trying to swing a full -time ride #

2301
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,320
# I never knew the cold hand of danger #

2304
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,120
#Till I met this one and took it inside #

2305
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,040
# Now I can't get near it #

2308
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:34,160
- Get a room! Really.
- # Don't want to hear it #

2309
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:36,520
# My cover's blown #

2312
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:39,000
# I walked in the rain like a drone #

2313
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:41,120
#All the way to Marquette #

2318
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,720
#The in_nite pet #

2319
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,160
# Oh, no #

2322
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,880
# No, no, no, no, no #

2323
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,160
# Cheaper than all your threats #

2326
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,560
- # No, no ##
- Shit.

2327
01:08:57,680 --> 01:09:00,280
I've been calling you every five minutes.
Are you okay?

2330
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,280
- I'm great.
- What happened to you?

2331
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:05,400
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- You always wanna talk about it.

2334
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,800
- Not this.
- Okay. Well, come on. Let's go.

2335
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,000
- Where are we going?
- It's Thursday!

2338
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:14,200
This one says, "Go for it!"

2339
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,600
And this one says, "You can do it!"

2342
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,640
We have a whole line
of inspirational photographic cards...

2343
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,720
featuring Pickles, my cat.

2346
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:24,560
I think people will really enjoy them.

2347
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:27,600
- Thank you.
- Good job, Rhoda.

2350
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:29,640
That's inspirational stuff.

2351
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,200
Okay. Who's next?

2354
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,760
We haven't heard from
Sympathy in a while.

2355
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,400
- Hansen?
- Yeah?

2358
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,120
The Winter Collection?
Do you have anything to contribute?

2359
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:42,160
Uh, no.

2362
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:44,080
I really don't.

2363
01:09:44,199 --> 01:09:46,120
Okay.

2366
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,440
We'll come back to you. Uh, McKenzie?

2367
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:52,160
- Actually, you know what?
- Yes, Tom?

2370
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:55,000
- Can I say something about the cat?
- Well, okay.

2371
01:09:55,119 --> 01:09:57,240
Yeah, uh, this is-

2374
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:59,280
And, Rhoda, no disrespect here...

2375
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:02,840
but, um, this is total shit.

2378
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,040
- Tom!
- "Go for it" and "You can do it"?

2379
01:10:05,159 --> 01:10:07,160
That's not inspirational. That's suicidal.

2382
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:10,040
if Pickles goes for it right there,
that's a dead cat.

2383
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:13,040
These are lies. We're liars.

2386
01:10:13,159 --> 01:10:15,320
Think about it.
Why do people buy these things?

2387
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:17,680
It's not 'cause they want
to say how they feel.

2390
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:21,560
People buy cards 'cause they can't
say how they feel, or they're afraid to.

2391
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,960
We provide the service
that lets them off the hook.

2394
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:27,440
You know what? I say, to hell with it!
Let's level with America.

2395
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:30,000
At least let them speak
for themselves! Right?

2398
01:10:30,119 --> 01:10:33,120
I mean, look!
What- What is this? What does it say?

2399
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:35,080
"Congratulations
on your new baby." Right?

2402
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:37,240
How 'bout, "Congratulations
on your new baby.

2403
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:40,440
- That's it for hanging out.
Nice knowing you."
- Sit down, Hansen.

2406
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,320
How 'bout this one, with all
the pretty hearts on the front?
I know where this is going. Yep!

2407
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:47,840
"Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart.
I love you."

2410
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,320
That sweet? Ain't love grand?

2411
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:53,440
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

2414
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,560
What does that even mean, "love"?

2415
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:58,320
Do you know? Do you? Anybody?

2420
01:10:58,479 --> 01:10:59,760
Tom.

2421
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,720
if somebody gave me this card,
Mr. Vance, I would eat it.

2424
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,640
It's- It's these cards,
and the movies, and the pop songs-

2425
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,240
They're to blame for all the lies...

2428
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,520
and the heartache, everything.

2429
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,280
And we're responsible. I'm responsible.

2432
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:22,880
I think we do a bad thing here.

2433
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,360
People should be able to say
how they feel- how they really feel-

2436
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:30,400
not, you know, some words
that some strangers put in their mouths.

2437
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,880
Words like "love"...

2440
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,960
that don't mean anything.

2441
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:41,200
sorry. I'm sorry. I, uh-

2444
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,560
I quit. I'm-

2445
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,160
There's enough bullshit in the world
without my help.

2450
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,280
All right. Next we do running drills.

2451
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:17,400
Hey, you're sketching again.

2454
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,640
Yeah, well, just doodling.

2455
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,280
Okay, Tom. We got twenty seconds.
Talk to me. You okay?

2458
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:25,480
Yeah, I'm good. I'm great.

2459
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:34,440
You know, my friends
are all in love with you.

2462
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,400
You know, it's like we said.

2463
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,480
- Plenty of other fish in the sea.
- Thanks.

2466
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,720
But, uh, those are guppies.

2467
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,640
Yeah.

2470
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,920
- Hey, Tom?
- Mmm.

2471
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:50,600
Look, I know you think
that she was the one...

2474
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,040
but I don't.

2475
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:57,240
Now, I think you're just remembering
the good stuff.

2478
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:00,160
Next time you look back, I, uh-

2479
01:13:00,279 --> 01:13:02,640
I really think you should look again.

2484
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:41,880
- It's playing at five.
- Do you wanna see it?

2485
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,720
Um, I don't know.
We could just go back to your place or-

2488
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:48,520
No, I really want to see it. Let's go.

2492
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,200
#Time it was and what a time it was #

2493
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:12,160
# It was #

2496
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,880
#A time of innocence #

2497
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,840
#A time of confidences #

2500
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,800
- You okay?
- Yeah.

2501
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:25,880
What- What is it? The movie?

2504
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,600
It's nothing. I'm just- I'm just being stupid.

2505
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:30,280
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2508
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:35,200
# Preserve your memories
They're all that's left you ##

2509
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:38,200
It pains me we live in a world...

2512
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:40,360
where nobody's heard of Spearmint.

2513
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:43,480
- I've never heard of them.
- I put 'em on that mix I made you.

2516
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,760
They're track one.

2517
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,080
Oh, yeah.

2521
01:15:13,479 --> 01:15:15,960
So, what do you wanna do?

2524
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:18,200
I think I'm just gonna call it a day.

2525
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:20,760
You don't wanna get some dinner?
Are you hungry?

2528
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,840
You all right?

2529
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,400
- I'm just tired.
- Okay.

2532
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,440
I got it. Pancakes!

2541
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,440
Oh, girl, I don't know
all the reasons why #

2544
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:25,240
# I found the answer looking in your eye #

2545
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,720
# I go out walking all day long #

2548
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,040
#Take away this lonely man
Soon he will be gone #

2549
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,360
# 'Cause I'll tell you everything #

2552
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,960
# About living free #

2553
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:45,640
#Yes, I can see you, girl #

2556
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,200
# Can you see me #

2557
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:57,360
# You don't need to know
what I do all day #

2560
01:16:57,479 --> 01:17:01,720
# It's as much as I know
Watch it waste away #

2561
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,080
# 'Cause I'll tell you everything #

2564
01:17:04,199 --> 01:17:08,040
# About living free #

2565
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,560
#Yes, I can see you, girl #

2568
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:18,720
# Can you see me #

2569
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,080
# 'Cause I'll tell you everything #

2572
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:47,800
# About being free #_

2573
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:27,960
Hey,Tom.

2576
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:43,920
I thought I might see you here.

2577
01:18:50,439 --> 01:18:53,560
I always loved this place,
ever since you brought me.

2580
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:56,240
So I, uh-

2581
01:18:56,359 --> 01:18:58,560
I guess I should say congratulations.

2584
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:02,000
Only if you mean it.

2585
01:19:02,119 --> 01:19:04,720
Ah. Well, in that case-

2588
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:14,000
So, are you okay?

2589
01:19:14,119 --> 01:19:17,000
I will be, eventually.

2592
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:19,360
- You wanna-
- Hmm.

2596
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,600
- I like your suit.
- Ah, thanks.

2597
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,840
- You look sharp.

2600
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,880
- So do you.
- Thanks.

2601
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,320
- I quit the office.
- You did?

2604
01:19:32,439 --> 01:19:34,640
I didn't know. That's great!

2605
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:38,200
And you, um-

2608
01:19:39,239 --> 01:19:41,040
you're married.

2609
01:19:41,159 --> 01:19:43,680
Yeah. It's crazy, huh?

2612
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,560
- You should have told me
when we were at the-
- I know.

2613
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,880
You know, at the wedding
when we were dancing.

2616
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,320
- Well, he hadn't asked me yet.
- But he was in your life.

2617
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:03,040
- Yeah.
- So why'd you dance with me?

2620
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,880
'Cause I wanted to.

2621
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:12,560
You just do what you want, don't you?

2624
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,720
You never wanted
to be anybody's girlfriend...

2625
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,960
and now you're somebody's wife.

2628
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:26,040
Surprised me too.

2629
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,840
I don't think I'll ever understand that.

2632
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:32,720
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

2633
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:36,080
It just happened.

2636
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:39,880
Right, but that's what I don't understand.
What just happened?

2637
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:44,120
I just- I just woke up one day, and I knew.

2640
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,040
Knew what?

2641
01:20:48,319 --> 01:20:50,680
What I was never sure of with you.

2646
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:06,200
You know what sucks?

2647
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:09,520
Realizing that everything you believe in
is complete and utter bullshit.

2650
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,480
- It sucks.
- What do you mean?

2651
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,400
Uh, you know, destiny,
and soul mates, and true love...

2654
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,960
and all that childhood fairy tale nonsense.

2655
01:21:20,079 --> 01:21:22,240
You were right.
I I should have listened to you.

2658
01:21:22,359 --> 01:21:25,640
- No.
- Yeah. What? What are you smiling at?

2659
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,160
- Tom.
- What?

2662
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,400
What are you looking at me like that for?

2663
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:36,000
Well, you know...

2666
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:38,200
I guess it's 'cause...

2667
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:40,760
I was sitting in a deli
and reading Dorian Gray...

2670
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,240
and... a guy comes up to me...

2671
01:21:43,359 --> 01:21:45,800
and asked me about it...

2674
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,760
and... now he's my husband.

2675
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,840
Yeah. And... so?

2678
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:57,640
So, what if I'd gone to the movies?

2679
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:02,440
What if I had gone
somewhere else for lunch?

2682
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,720
What if I'd gotten there ten minutes later?

2683
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:09,120
It was-

2686
01:22:09,239 --> 01:22:11,480
It was meant to be.

2687
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,120
And I just kept thinking...

2690
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,720
- Tom was right.
- No.

2691
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:19,800
Yeah, I did.

2694
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,280
I did.

2695
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,080
It just wasn't me that you were right about.

2698
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,440
I should go.

2699
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,400
But I'm really happy to see
that you're doing well.

2704
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,440
Summer!

2705
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:14,520
I really do hope that you're happy.

2708
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:49,960
Most days of the year are unremarkable.

2709
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:52,960
They begin and they end...

2712
01:23:53,079 --> 01:23:56,840
with no lasting memories
made in between.

2713
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,320
Most days have no impact...

2716
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:01,320
on the course of a life.

2717
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:05,080
May twenty third was a Wednesday.

2720
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:24,920
- Are you interviewing?
- sorry?

2721
01:24:25,039 --> 01:24:28,480
Are you interviewing for the position?

2724
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:31,000
- Oh, yeah. Why? Are you?
- Yeah.

2725
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:32,920
Mm hmm.

2728
01:24:33,039 --> 01:24:35,000
My competition.

2729
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:37,680
It would appear.

2732
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:41,720
Yeah. So, a little awkward.

2733
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,680
Yeah.


2736
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:49,400
Well, I hope you, um, don't get the job.

2737
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,880
Well, I hope you don't get the job.

2741
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,560
Have I seen you before?

2744
01:24:57,680 --> 01:24:59,560
Me? I don't think so.

2745
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,240
Do you ever go to Angelus Plaza?

2748
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,080
Yes. That's, like, my favorite spot in the city.

2749
01:25:06,199 --> 01:25:08,120
Yeah. Okay.
Except for the parking lots, but-

2752
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,040
- Yeah. I- I agree.
- Yeah, yeah.

2753
01:25:10,159 --> 01:25:12,080
- I think I've seen you there.
- Really?

2756
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:14,880
- Yeah.
- I haven't seen you.

2757
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:19,080
You must not have been looking.

2760
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:21,080
If Tom had learned anything...

2761
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:24,080
it was that you can't ascribe
great cosmic significance...

2764
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:26,160
to a simple earthly event.

2765
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:31,600
Coincidence. That's all anything ever is.

2768
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,560
Nothing more than coincidence.

2769
01:25:33,680 --> 01:25:35,920
-Tom Hansen.
-Yeah.

2772
01:25:36,039 --> 01:25:37,920
- Come on back.
- Thank you.

2773
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:43,000
Tom had finally learned
there are no miracles.

2776
01:25:43,119 --> 01:25:45,440
There's no such thing as fate.

2777
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:47,840
Nothing is meant to be.

2780
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,360
He knew. He was sure of it now.

2781
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:54,040
- Tom was-
-sorry. Um-

2784
01:25:54,159 --> 01:25:56,240
I just left, uh- Can I- One second.

2785
01:25:56,359 --> 01:25:58,960
He was pretty sure.

2788
01:25:59,079 --> 01:26:02,000
- Hey.
- You again.

2789
01:26:02,119 --> 01:26:04,280
Yeah. I, uh, was just wondering...

2792
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:07,520
if maybe after this, if, um, you-

2793
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:11,880
you want to get some coffee or something.

2796
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,880
Oh, I'm sorry.

2797
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,840
I'm sort of supposed
to meet someone after this.

2800
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:19,760
Okay.

2801
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,680
Sure.

2804
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,240
- What's that?
- Why not?

2805
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:34,480
Okay. Well, then I'll just, uh-
I'll wait for you-

2808
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,600
- We- We'll figure it out.
- We'll figure it out.

2809
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:40,760
- My name's Tom.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Autumn.

2812
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:59,280
# She's got you high
and you don't even know yet #

2813
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:02,680
# She's got you high

2816

It's warming up your bare legs #

you're looking for the sunset #

2825
01:27:20,239 --> 01:27:23,800
# Have you lost your mind
or has she taken all of yours too #

2828
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:27,240
# What's this about
I figured love would shine through #

2829
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:30,800
# We've lost romance
